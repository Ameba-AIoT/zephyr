  Realtek's GDMA (General Direct Memory Access) Node

  General Direct Memory Access (GDMA) is a feature that allows
  peripheral-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, and memory-to-memory
  data transfer.

  The GDMA controller in ameba has eight independent channels,
  each channel can be connected to different peripherals.

  For the client part, example for ameba on dma instance
    Tx using channel 3
    Rx using channel 2
    spi1 {
     compatible = "realtek,ameba-spi";
     dmas = <&dma 3 1>,
            <&dma 2 1>;
     dma-names = "tx", "rx";
    };

compatible: "realtek,ameba-gdma"
